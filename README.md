- 👋 Hi, I’m @RafoDias
- 👀 I’m interested in gamedev, specially tactics and strategy games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code. I know a bit of python and C#, and have been trying Unity and Godot. I'm still unsure which way to go, so I am taking some Computer Science classes hoping I get knowledgeable enough to make a wise decision
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game projects, someday. When I am skilled enough to actually be helpful


estou com preguiça de pensar mais
